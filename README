Linker is a macOS shell script and Finder QuickAction to create relative or absolute symbolic links, hard links, Finder aliases, file clones or legacy file copies

Latest release: https://github.com/JayBrown/Linker/releases/latest

* install linker shell script into your $PATH

* supported paths for installation:
/usr/local/bin
/opt/local/bin
/opt/sw/bin
/sw/bin
~/.local/bin
~/local/bin
~/bin
~/Developer/bin

* execute the following, if the script doesn't run: chmod +x ./linker

* install QuickAction (workflow) with Automator Installer

In Finder you can just use the QuickAction from the contextual menu.

You will have the following options on the command-line, for tool integration in file managers like Nimble Commander, or via the Touch Bar using BetterTouchTool:

linker
	-a		:	create Finder alias
	-c		:	create cloned file copy (only on APFS)
	-d		:	create legacy file copy (true duplicate)
	-h		:	create hard link (only on HFS+ volumes)
	-r		:	create symbolic link with relative path
	-s		:	create symbolic link with absolute path

Please note that even the above options will still use the GUI for the user to select the destination directory.

Linker uses a code snippet from StackExchange: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/85068/222515
