Linker is a macOS shell script and Finder QuickAction to create relative or absolute symbolic links, hard links, Finder aliases, Bookmark files, file clones or legacy file copies

Latest release: https://github.com/JayBrown/Linker/releases/latest
Successfully tested on: macOS 10.15.7 (Catalina) & macOS 10.13.6 (High Sierra)

* install linker shell script into your $PATH

* supported paths for installation:
/usr/local/bin
/opt/local/bin
/opt/sw/bin
/sw/bin
~/.local/bin
~/local/bin
~/bin
~/Developer/bin

* execute the following, if the script doesn't run: chmod +x ./linker

* Mojave & later: install QuickAction workflow with Automator Installer
* High Sierra & earlier: install the Service workflow with Automator Installer

* Mojave 10.14.3 and earlier (optional): install the Swift 5 Runtime Support for Command Line Tools: https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1998?locale=en_US

In Finder you can just use the QuickAction from the contextual menu (or the Service on older systems).

You will have the following options on the command-line, for tool integration in file managers like Nimble Commander, or via the Touch Bar using BetterTouchTool:

linker
	-a		:	create Finder Alias
	-b		:	create Bookmark file (same as Finder Alias on newer systems)
	-c		:	create cloned file copy (only on APFS)
	-d		:	create legacy file copy (true duplicate)
	-h		:	create hard link (only on HFS+ volumes)
	-r		:	create symbolic link with relative path
	-s		:	create symbolic link with absolute path

Please note that even the above options will still use the GUI for the user to select the destination directory.
